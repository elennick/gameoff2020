game entites:

player
* player character that attempts to get from the beginning of the level to the moon at the end

obstacles (block movement or affect movement but dont kill)
* planets and planetoids that the player can jump between
** some may be static but some are not static and move/orbit/rotate
* walls or other barriers

dangers
* turrets firing seeking missiles
* turrets firing bullets
* static barriers (doesnt kill but blocks movement and bullets)
* moving barriers (doesnt kill but blocks movement and bullets)
* laser barriers that turn off and on (do kill)




game systems required:
* physics system where planetoids and other components have gravity and can collide
* level defining and loading system so there can be many levels with different paths to the goal
* components that can be laid out level both as obstacles and dangers

game screens required:
* title screen - can be simple and just have a title and describe controls
* gameplay screen - loads levels and lets the player play them



misc todo
* timer to track how long it takes to beat a level, potentially tracking high scores / fastest times
* death animation
* flag on moon
* fix missile homing
* menu + menu music + title logo stuff
* level start countdown thing
* sound effects
* bonus - level editor

bugs
* missile sounds keep playing into next level
* you can jump/move during the initial fall onto a planet when a level starts


level ideas
* level where guns/missiles fire off and on and player has to bunker down behind walls between volleys
* level where laser gates opening causes a barrage of fire to come through (similar to above)
* level where a certain type of planet kills you if you land on it, have to use gravity to jump around it
* make gravity variable in different levels so that different types of jumps and orbits are possible


make local - runs using locally installed LOVE2D (should be 11.3 installed)
make web-build - builds the web version of the game using love-js
make web-zip - builds the web version of the game using love-js and then zips it up (to be uploaded to itch)
make web - builds using love-js and then runs in chrome locally using a python webserver
make clean - deletes builds directory used for the web build



levels

1 - title screen - teaches controls and that you have to jump to the moon to beat the level
2 - lily pads - teaches jumping across several planet to get to your destination
3 - walled off - teaches about walls blocking jumps
4 - theyre shooting at us! - teaches about turrets and bullets
5 - it's following you - teaches about turrets that track the player
