## General
This game is my submission to the Github Gameoff 2020 gamejam: https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2020

Super Moonshot Adventure was created using:
* LOVE2D 11.3 - https://love2d.org
* Love.js - https://github.com/Davidobot/love.js
* Assets from Itch.io - https://itch.io/game-assets/free
* Sound effects from Freesound.org - https://freesound.org

Title art was created by Kristian Correa.

## Building Levels
All levels in the game are loaded on startup from a JSON file located in the `levels/` directory: https://github.com/elennick/moonshotadv/blob/main/levels/levels.json.

This file can be modified or added to by updating the information and rebuilding and restarting the game.

## Makefile commands
This project has several targets to help run and build from the command line in Mac OSX (and possibly Linux). Most of these targets revolve around building and running the web version of the game. In order for most of these targets to function, several other commands will need to be available including `make`, `love`, `love-js` and `python`.
* `make local` = build and run game using local Love2D install
* `make web` = build using love.js and run in Chrome
* `make web-build` = build using love.js
* `make web-zip` = build using love.js and zip into deployment artifact
* `make web-clean` = delete the /build directory generated by love.js

## Libraries
SMA uses several libraries available for Love2D/Lua including:
* Middleclass - https://github.com/kikito/middleclass
* Anim8 - https://github.com/kikito/anim8
* Windfield - https://github.com/a327ex/windfield
* json.lua - https://github.com/rxi/json.lua
